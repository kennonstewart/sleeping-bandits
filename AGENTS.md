# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS: Unlearning-Bandit Simulation Suite Setup

Your primary goal is to initialize the repository for the **Unlearning-Bandit Simulation Suite**. You will create the necessary directory structure and populate it with Python files containing the class and method skeletons for the three core modules described in the research paper.

Adhere to the following steps precisely.

### **Step 1: Create Directory Structure**

First, create the following directories and empty `__init__.py` files to establish the Python package structure:

```bash
mkdir -p unlearning_bandits/unlearning_bandits
mkdir -p unlearning_bandits/experiments
mkdir -p unlearning_bandits/config
mkdir -p unlearning_bandits/tests

touch unlearning_bandits/unlearning_bandits/__init__.py
touch unlearning_bandits/tests/__init__.py
